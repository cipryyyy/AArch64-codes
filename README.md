# AArch64-codes
My personal repo of AArch64 codes, adapted for Apple M1 chip with clang compiler.

I'm using decompiled C codes to learn, so I'm saving those bits of codes to understand how it works.

## ⚠️⚠️WARNING⚠️⚠️

I'm running those codes directly on my computer cause I'm a careless dumb masochist, so if they're uploaded here 99% they work.

In the other 1% of the cases the computer may crash, so if you really wanna try those codes without an emulator, good luck.
